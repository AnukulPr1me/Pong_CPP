# Pong Game with C++ and Raylib

## Overview

This Pong game is a simple yet engaging project built using C++ and the Raylib library. It serves as an excellent exercise for practicing object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, showcasing the implementation of key game elements using classes and objects.

## Features

- **Classic Pong Gameplay:** Experience the timeless joy of Pong, where two players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth.
  
- **Object-Oriented Design:** The game is structured using object-oriented principles, with classes representing entities such as the paddle and ball. This design enhances code organization and maintainability.

- **Raylib Library Integration:** Leveraging the power of the Raylib library, the game achieves smooth graphics rendering and user input handling. Raylib provides a lightweight and easy-to-use platform for 2D game development in C++.

- **Two-Player Mode:** Enjoy multiplayer fun by competing with a friend in a local two-player mode. Each player controls a paddle, adding a competitive edge to the classic Pong experience.

## How to Play

1. **Player Controls:**
   - Player: Control the second paddle with the arrow keys (`Up` and `Down`).
